Here is a simple project that I created based on what I learned during DataSense Analytics' free webinar on Web Scraping through MS Excel Power Query.
I realized how powerful MS Excel is. I never even thought that you can do web scraping using Excel power query. I learned that this skill is very important as it enables a data analyst to obtain any information directly from the web that can be updated automatically even in real-time. I learned that it is not all about technical skills, it is also about how well you analyze the given data to provide data-driven insights and informed decisions for the benefit of your company/others.

I discovered how difficult the ETL process is when doing my own project. Yet, it is fun and exciting especially once you achieve your goal as a data analyst. 



This free webinar really bestowed skills that are invaluable for aspiring data analysts. Thanks, Sir Abs! To God be the glory!

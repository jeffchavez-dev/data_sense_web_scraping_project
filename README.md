Here is a simple project that I created based on what I learned during DataSensePH's free webinar on Web Scraping through MS Excel Power Query.

I realized how powerful excel is. I never even thought that you can do web scraping using excel power query. I learned that this skill is very important as it enable a data analyst to obtain any information directly from the web that can be updated automatically even real-time. I learned that it is not all about the technical skills, it is also about how well you analyze the given data to provide data-driven insights and informed decision for the benefit of your company/others.

I discovered how difficult ETL is, when doing my own project. Yet, it is fun and exciting especially once you achieve your goal as a data analyst. 

I'll improve this project as I continue my journey as a data analyst. Feel free to provide comment, suggestions, and criticisms that will help me scale my skills all the more.

This free webinar really bestowed skills that are invaluable for aspiring data analyst. Thanks, Sir Abs! To God be the glory!
